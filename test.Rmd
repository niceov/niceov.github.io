This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
time = c(14,18,11,13,18,17,21,9,16,17,14,15,         12,12,14,13,6,18,14,16,10,7,15,10)
group=c(rep(1:2, each=12))
sleep = data.frame(time, group)
require(boot)
diff = function(d1,i){
  d = d1; 
  d$group <- d$group[i]; # randomly re-assign groups
  Mean= tapply(X=d$time, INDEX=d$group, mean)
  Diff = Mean[1]-Mean[2]
  Diff
}
set.seed(1234)
b4 = boot(data = sleep, statistic = diff, R = 5000)
mean(abs(b4$t) > abs(b4$t0))
sd(abs(b4$t) > abs(b4$t0))

plot(density(time))
```
